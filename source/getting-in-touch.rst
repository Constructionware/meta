There are quite a few ways to get involved with the PyCQA.

#. You can contribute directly to projects in a variety of ways

#. You can start discussions by opening issues on our meta_ repository

#. You can chat with us on IRC on the Freenode_ server in the 
   ``##python-code-quality`` channel (See also ":ref:`using-irc`")

#. You can join our `mailing list`_ (this list does not receive a large amount
   of messages so it should not cause an information overload if you join)

Using IRC
=========

IRC_ is an old and durable protocol that allows people to chat in real time.
There are many ways to begin using IRC but we recommend using Freenode's 
webchat_ as it is both secure (served over TLS) and should work in any
browser. IRCHelp.org has a great tutorial_ to learn how to use IRC.

If you outgrow Freenode's webchat, there are a number of other options for
connecting to IRC. Wikipedia has an overwhelmingly long `list of IRC
clients`_.

The following is a list of clients that the current members of the PyCQA use:

OS X
----

- Textual (Graphical, WebKit based)

- weechat (Curses, Terminal program)

Linux
-----

- weechat (Curses, Terminal program)

- irssi (Curses, Terminal program)
